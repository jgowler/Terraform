# Terraform Azure Deployments  

This repository contains **Terraform configurations** designed to automate deployments in **Microsoft Azure**, streamlining **infrastructure provisioning**, enforcing best practices, and enabling **scalable cloud architectures**.

## Current Projects  

### Hub-and-Spoke Network  
A **secure network design** that enhances connectivity and segmentation through:  
- **Azure Firewall** for centralized security policy enforcement  
- **VNet peering** to establish efficient spoke network communication  
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs)** for granular traffic segmentation and routing  

## Upcoming Projects  

### Conditional Access Policies  
A robust security framework that strengthens **identity and access management**, leveraging **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** to enforce policies based on:  
- **Device compliance** to ensure security standards are met  
- **User location and risk assessment** for adaptive authentication  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** to protect against unauthorized access
